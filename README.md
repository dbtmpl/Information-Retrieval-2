# Information-Retrieval-2

Current project structure:
```
IR2/
 - apex/ (not used yet)
 - OpenNIR/
 - src/ (this repo)
   - data/
     - qulac/ (here all OpenNIR/anserini stuff will be saved)
     - documents/webclue_docs/
       - {1-200}.json (currently using only 1.json)
```
Everything else will be generated by running OpenNIR.

To use OpenNIR as a library:
```
git clone https://github.com/Georgetown-IR-Lab/OpenNIR.git
cd OpenNIR
pip install -e .
```
Because of some hard coded paths we need to run our stuff from the OpenNIR folder. Like this:
``` 
python ../src/start.py config/conv_knrm ../src/config/qulac
```
By using the OpenNIR`util.Registry` we can put our code (new Dataset, Trainer, Ranker, etc.) in our `src` (see qulac.py as example).
