# Information-Retrieval-2

Current project structure:
```
IR2/
 - apex/ (not used yet)
 - OpenNIR/
 - src/ (this repo)
   - data/
     - qulac/ (here all OpenNIR/anserini stuff will be saved)
     - documents/webclue_docs/
       - {1-200.json} (currently using only 1.json)
```
Everything else will be generated by running OpenNIR.

To use OpenNIR as a library:
```
git clone https://github.com/Georgetown-IR-Lab/OpenNIR.git
cd OpenNIR
pip install -e .
```
Because of some hard coded paths we need to run our stuff from the OpenNIR folder
``` 
python ../src/start.py config/conv_knrm ../src/config/qulac
```
The idea is that we can put all of our code in `src` (this repo) and just extend existing OpenNIR classes, but this maybe not
possible due to its design. In the worst case we need to put our code directly into `OpenNIR/`.
